This is solution for [workshop]. I feel that I've take a slightly different path from the one intended by the authors (other workshops was much more clear/straightforward to me except [one other]), so I'm asking to review my solution to this one.

# solution and exercise text

[Workshop] offers 7 tasks, which are solved in 4 branches. The [first commit](https://github.com/skaunov/6991_ws05/commit/ffb3cdee5b2f00bc1d96f2115346f817c857e991) for all of them is the initial code provided as the workshop starter. This (`master`) branch contains solution to tasks 1-4, and solutions to tasks #5 to #7 are presented in their own respective branches: 
5) <https://github.com/skaunov/6991_ws05/tree/test_pulsar>,
6) <https://github.com/skaunov/6991_ws05/tree/test_distantoid>,
7) <https://github.com/skaunov/6991_ws05/tree/test_combination_task7>.

For archiving and convinience reasons text of the workshop can be found at <https://github.com/skaunov/6991_ws05/blob/master/README_exerciseText.md>.

# PS 
AFAIU the only thing that shouldn't be publicly shared are solutions to the graded exercises/activities, which I keep access restricted. If I got anything wrong and this code shouldn't be public as well, pls approach me by any mean you like, and I'll remove it without hesitations. Tom received couple of my contacts (via `macrokata`/`lifetimekata` repos, <https://discord.com/channels/1075940806004838470/1075940806004838475/1101303841531646092>).
